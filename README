br-pbuilder
Parallel builder for Buildroot that uses an acyclic graph

The graph is organized according to the packages dependencies

The graph is created in levels, the graph's root is a package that does not have
any dependency on any package. The second level contains packages whose only
dependency is the graph's root that is the previous level; the third level
contains packages whose dependencies are the packages in the second level and
the graph's root; and so on.
Each package may have one or more dependencies and all of them must be in higher
levels.
